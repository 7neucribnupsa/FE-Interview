However, playing Starcraft Gundam Century requires some steps and tools that are not very straightforward. You need to have the original Starcraft game installed on your computer, as well as the Brood War expansion pack. You also need to download the Gundam Century mod file from Mod DB[^1^], which is a zip file containing the mod files and a crack file. The crack file is necessary to bypass the CD check that Starcraft performs when launching the game.
 
To install the mod, you need to extract the zip file to your Starcraft folder, which is usually located at C:\Program Files\StarCraft. You should see a folder called GundamCentury inside your Starcraft folder. Then, you need to copy the crack file, which is named StarCraft.exe, and paste it into your Starcraft folder, replacing the original StarCraft.exe file. This will allow you to play the game without inserting the CD.
 
To launch the mod, you need to run the GundamCentury.exe file inside the GundamCentury folder. This will start Starcraft with the Gundam Century mod enabled. You can choose to play single-player or multiplayer modes, as well as customize your settings and options. You can also switch back to the original Starcraft game by running the StarCraft.exe file inside your Starcraft folder.
 
Starcraft Gundam Century is a fun and unique mod that offers a new perspective on one of the most classic strategy games of all time. If you are looking for a challenge and a change of scenery, you should give it a try and enjoy the epic battles between mobile suits.

## What are the features and reviews of Starcraft Gundam Century?
 
Starcraft Gundam Century is not just a cosmetic mod, but a complete overhaul of the game mechanics and balance. The mod replaces the three original races of Starcraft (Terran, Protoss, and Zerg) with three factions from the Gundam universe (Earth Federation, Zeon, and Neo Zeon). Each faction has its own unique units, buildings, technologies, and abilities that reflect their characteristics and strategies in the anime series.
 
For example, the Earth Federation relies on mass-produced mobile suits and support units that can adapt to different situations and environments. They have access to powerful beam weapons and shields, as well as versatile aircraft and battleships. The Zeon faction focuses on specialized mobile suits that excel in certain roles and terrains. They have strong melee attacks and stealth capabilities, as well as devastating nuclear weapons and mobile armors. The Neo Zeon faction is a splinter group of Zeon that seeks to revive their ideals and glory. They have advanced mobile suits that can transform into different modes and use psycho-frame technology to enhance their performance and control.
 
The mod also changes the gameplay aspects of Starcraft to make it more realistic and immersive. For instance, the mod introduces a new resource system that requires players to collect energy and materials from generators and refineries. The energy is used to power up units and buildings, while the materials are used to construct and repair them. The mod also adds a new feature called morale, which affects the performance and behavior of units in combat. Units with high morale will fight better and obey orders, while units with low morale will panic and flee. Morale can be influenced by various factors, such as casualties, victories, defeats, terrain, weather, and commander skills.
 
Starcraft Gundam Century has received positive reviews from fans and critics alike. The mod has been praised for its high-quality graphics, sounds, animations, and models that capture the essence and atmosphere of the Gundam series. The mod has also been commended for its deep and complex gameplay that offers a lot of variety and challenge for both casual and hardcore players. The mod has been rated 7.8 out of 10 by 25 users on Mod DB[^2^], with most of them giving it a 10 out of 10 score. Some of the comments from the reviewers are:
